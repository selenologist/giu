## *Gloriously* Inefficient UI

### Rust-powered graph/node based browser UI

### **This isn't usable yet.**

There's some really nasty code here too, not much care was taken and things are pretty poorly designed. I've never used d3js before and I'm still using it wrong.

One day it's gonna be *glorious*.
