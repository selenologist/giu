# GIU
## *Gloriously* Inefficient UI

### Rust-powered graph/node based browser UI

### **This isn't usable yet.**

#### Status: On hold but not abandoned. Currently frustrated with the clumsiness of my GUI code. Rust code also needs cleanup and updating to latest versions of tokio and futures.

There's some really nasty code here too, not much care was taken and things are pretty poorly designed. I've never used d3js before and I'm still using it wrong.

One day it's gonna be *glorious*.
